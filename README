Mojolicious::Plugin::TagHelpers::NoCaching
==========================================

When you updating your project on production with new version,
new version often contains changed styles, javascript, images.
You fetched all new files from the repository, restarted application,
but browsers still shows you old images, your html looks like a
shit (because of old styles on new html), javascript events doesn't
work (because of the old javascript). All of this because your browser
cached old version of included files and don't want to reload it.

If you ever come across this, this module will help you.
